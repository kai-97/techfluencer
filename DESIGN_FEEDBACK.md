| ITEM | SCORE | FEEDBACK |
| --- | --- | --- |
| <tr><th colspan=3> Setup </th></tr> |
| **Problem Stmt** | 7.5/15 | The "problem statement" is clearly written and explains what the bot will be doing (more like bot description), but there's no problem identified -- is it something like "People don't get enough praise"?  This is missing "The problem is..." |
| **Bot Description** | 10.0/10 | This is fine. |
| **Use Cases** | 6.0/15 | NOTE THIS IS FEEDBACK YOU PREVIOUSLY RECEIVED<br /><br />You have a start on your Use Cases, but they need Revisions:    UC1 seems entirely disconnected from the problem statement and bot description.  <br>Every subflow [s*] should be mentioned in the main flow -- it's supposed to "flow" from the main use case at a particual point, and include extra deails about the data that's used.<br><br>UC2 is not a use case: "Experts may or may not be notified of an unanswered question. They can answer those questions and gain points."   This is not a flow since it happens outside your bot no? <br><br>UC3 is imcomplete -- Once the ranking occur, how are the users impacted?  Are badges updated? |
| **Wireframes** | 3.0/15 | Wireframs show what data will be shown to the users.  The layout is where that information will be shown to users -- this is just boxes -- what goes in the boxes? |
| **Storyboard** | 7.5/15 | Storyboards tell a story and do not need to show details about information layout.    This is more like a use case with screen layout mockups. |
| **Architecture + Additional Patterns** | 10.0/30 |  The assigment section for Architecture Design says "This section should be several diagrams + paragraphs of text".      There is only 1 diagram.<br><br>This is not the singleton pattern.   Singleton is a object-oriented pattern, and it sounds like your describing a single executable running the bot. <br><br>Calling commands is not the command pattern:  refer to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_pattern<br><br> |
